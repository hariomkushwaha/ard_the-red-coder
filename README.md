# Smart Agriculture and Guidance System

Our product has three main modules: 
* **Prediction** model tells user the exact crops suitable for the given climate and soil conditions.
* After prediction the **Guidance** model will provide the weekly information necessary to grow the crops along with the right amount of Fertilizer and Water required. This ensures that the wastage and hence pollution is reduced.
* We have integrated an Ecommerce store to our platform so that the users can buy crops directly from the farmers. This will also enable the urban farmers to sell their surplus. All the users will also have an added benefit to buy various tools and fertilizers from the platform.
